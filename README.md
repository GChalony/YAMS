# YAMS modelling

This repo was created to get some input on best strategies to play for YAMS.  

So far, the question is not to have the _best_ policy, but simply to know what to do in some simplified situation.

The goal is to add more and more study cases to build a better understanding of the probabilities behind (and especially get an _intuitive feel_ for them). Any addition would be greatly appreciated :wink:.
